# My Path to Programming
###### 4 July 2020

From taking a High School class in Java, to self-taught programmers at 30, programming is a field open to all across the world with access to computer of some kind. Being a curious and mathematically-minded student in early Secondary School, this quality led me on a path that would reform my experience of education for years to come.

I first learned to program in python - messy, incomprehensible python - in at around 12. After hearing the language mentioned in our rare Computer Science Lessons, I decided to explore further, reading and learning all I could about this seemingly alien art. Beginning with small "Guess the number" programs, I quickly build a vast repertoire of crude but nonetheless awesome projects, as I saw them.

The satisfaction of a clean execution after hours of tussling with python's extensive syntax error's and worse - seemingly phantom logical errors - was unique in a sea of homework, even from the subjects I most enjoyed. Soon, I began to progress to larger programs, using  concepts and techniques learned outside the classroom; when I was 13, I built an [enigma emulator](https://github.com/mgsium/_enigma), my first fully fledged project.

The more I learned, the more I realized I was late to the party.

The ubiquity of programming resources meant thousands of like-minded students around the country had already explored their chosen language, in much the same way I had. With this knowledge, I began to lose hope. I had started programming because it was a unique vocation - something I alone could enjoy  beyond the relative repetitiveness of school life.

I began to abandon python, picking up web programming with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This was unfamiliar territory - I had no experience with markup languages or styling , let alone embedding procedural JavaScript in the mix. I used the little language-learning experience I has amassed with python to learn and understand the basics from online tutorials and forums, like stackoverflow. I made an fact randomize-r site (no longer on github), which randomized a topic about which facts would be shown then later, a [Revision scheduler](https://mgsium.github.io/studentTools/tools/scheduler.html) to organize exam preparation, this time using the bootstrap UI kit and more JavaScript to automate searching processes. This was around the time I began to use the version control system git and its most popular online host, github, to organize and manage my projects. I was picking up momentum.

Now, it was the summer before the start of Year 12, and I wanted to make some real progress. I tried a panoply of different languages and frameworks, from the visual language ProcessingJS to create small solar system animations, to writing and compiling C and C++ on the command line with the gcc compiler to building the beginnings of this blog. I began another web project with a simple premise - an task management app - to build and improve upon my skills in web programming. Using the new framework I had learned - ReactJS - I built a first iteration in the summer months. This project would - in its third iteration - become [Conure](https://www.conureapp.co.uk/), a web app I continue to maintain today.

It was that summer I attended the "Elite" Stage of GCHQ's national cyber security competition. After over 100 hours of challenges and theory work, I attended a 3-day camp at Birmingham University, during which I dabbled in Lua and C further, both occasionally used for scripting in a ethical hacking environment, though more commonly the latter. This further added to my experience in reading and absorbing documentation to quickly ingest syntactic and logical components of new programming languages.

Equipped with this knowledge, I began Year 12.

In the Autumn, I attended my first Hackathon: HackTheMidlands 4.0. Here, I worked with another Year 12 student (from another school) and a master's student from York Univeristy on an comedy web app called "RedditAgainstHumanity", using a pytorch machine learning model - trained on $100 free vouchers for Google's Cloud Platform - in conjunction with a NodeJS frontend and Flask backend. The hackathon environment and the idea of over 12 hours of uninterrupted coding reignited my interest. Soon after the event, I implemented Conway's Game of Life (at <https://gameoflifeneo.com>), a cellular automaton environment invented by English Mathematician John Conway in the 1970s. This first exposed me to JSON-formatted data, file uploads, and UI/UX design.

At this point, I began to learn Rust, applying my learning experience, to build a lightweight version management system called [viper-rs](https://github.com/mgsium/viper-rs), which ranked #25 in python-related packages on Rust's package registry, crates.io. At the same time, I spent dozens of hours building a third iteration of the Conure (see the earlier link). I also worked on my python, building a Discord bot for our maths thread on Discord, as well as starting to build a WSGI-driven backend system for my Computing Project. I've used quarantine as an opportunity to accelerate my programming, using tools and frameworks more typical of a professional environment than limiting myself a school environment, allowing me to build larger and more maintainable projects (see my Projects page for some of these!).

Soon, my local 166th Mickleover Scout group (at which I had been a scout, and continue to be a young leader) reached out to revamp their website - this was a big step into externalizing what I had learned, and building applications real people would use.

Since I began programming, I have become proficient in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C# and Java, including a mix of frameworks within each. I now program on a daily basis, working to build my skills with the aim of not only becoming a better software engineer, but expanding my scope of appreciation for the complexity and diversity of the technology industry. I founded and - alongside my CompSci peers - run a code club at my school for younger students and volunteer at a weekly code club to contribute to these ideals, opening up the world in our small way to a new era of Computer Science.
