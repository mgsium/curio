# Open Thinking and it's Benefits
###### 23 August 2019

Many ideas and concepts only exist due to a collective imagination: Money is only worth more (or less) than the paper it is printed on not because a group of high-brow bankers on Wall Street have calculated its exact value, but because everyone thinks so.

Many ideas and concepts only exist due to a collective imagination: Money is only worth more (or less) than the paper it is printed on not because a group of high-brow bankers on Wall Street have calculated its exact value, but because everyone thinks so.

Evidently, then, some of these "myths" carry more utility than others - however, this is not the primary distinction to be made. The primary distinction is determined by your ability to expand horizons beyond the domain of the particular myth - in other words, the inverse of the myth's restrictive intellectual effect.

This reason, among others, is what makes the relative value of currency so unstable. The physical matter comprising an intact US bank note does not change from one week to the next yet its value fluctuates wildly. We are constantly re-adjusting our perceptions of worth - even to points we have recently pivoted from - to best fit the current situation.

Paradoxically, this heuristic of doubt (better yet, willingness to accept being wrong) can also cause the opposite effect - this is best seen in the theological world. Religion has remained remarkably stable over the last millennia. Roughly the same 4 central religions dominate and, although there is constant fluctuations in membership to each of these religions, this is unlikely to change in years to come.

The political scene, on the other hand, has been a relative minefield. In Russia, dissident nihilism, disorganised narodnikism and destructive socialism all took hold within a half-century, leading to to one of the bloodiest sequence of revolution, civil war and famine in human history.

Why is this? If the nuances of thought detailed above applied, then surely there would be constant inter-movement between religions, to the set of beliefs that fit the month, day, or even hour to the best degree?

The problem is two-fold. The first issue lies with the opening sentence: "Many ideas and concepts only exist due to a collective imagination". Since the "collective" in each instance of the world's main four religions numbers many hundreds of millions, there is an overabundance of confirmation bias - if 100 million people are saying you're right there is reason to believe so.

This alone, however, does not solve the central issue: there is confirmation bias across all religions thus this would not prevent inter-movement. No, the second part is the crucial: Religion requires that one believes in the literal truth of these stories and thus cannot deviate.
